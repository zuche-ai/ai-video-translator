# TODO: Audio Translation Pipeline

## Docker Optimization
- [ ] **Pre-download ML models and mount them in Docker** (similar to video translator)
  - Silero VAD model (~139MB)
  - Whisper base model (~1GB) 
  - Transformers translation model (Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es)
  - Coqui XTTS models (several GB)
  - Mount as volumes to avoid first-time download delays
  - Update Dockerfile to copy pre-downloaded models

## Pipeline Improvements
- [ ] Add more robust error handling for model loading failures
- [ ] Add progress callbacks for long-running operations
- [ ] Implement model caching strategy
- [ ] Add configuration for model paths and settings

## Testing & QA
- [ ] Create automated tests for each pipeline step
- [ ] Add segment-by-segment verification scripts
- [ ] Visualize audio segments for QA
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## API Enhancements
- [ ] Add async processing with job status endpoints
- [ ] Add model preloading endpoint
- [ ] Add configuration endpoint for model settings
- [ ] Add health check for model availability
